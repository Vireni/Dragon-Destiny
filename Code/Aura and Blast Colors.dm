Every ki icon that is black are icons with colors that I want to be changed depending on the person's choice of aura colors. When they make
their character, I want a prompt of the color hexagon to appear and ask for their aura and blast color. Whatever they choose is the color
that replaces all the black in the ki icons. If they transform and their aura is supposed to change color, such as Super Saiyan, there will
be a separate golden/whatever color icon that is needed, and their blast colors will change to whatever color their super form will be (only
if the Super Form does it). (Contact me if that last line didn't make sense, I'll try my best to explain).

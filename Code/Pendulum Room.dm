The Pendulum room is one of the available rooms at the lookout. When you enter it, there's a console that'll take you to whatever battle in
the DB-DBZ-DB:S universe you want. There you will face NPCS with Power Levels of the real deal, up to scale with the DD system. You can
fight them, but if you are koed, you will automatically be transported back to the pendulum room. It's kind of like the time vault in
Xenoverse. I shall place the battles you can choose from and the NPC power levels here soon.

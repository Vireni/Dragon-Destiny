In order to get sleep, you need to meditate in either a bed or a bedroll. You will then be transported to the dream world for the duration
until you wake up again. You'll be free to move and do whatever you wish in the dream world, and you won't grow hungry while in the dream
world. If you die in your dream, you are forced to wake up back to reality, unless killed by a supernatural force (which I will explain
later).

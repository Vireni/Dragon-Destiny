When you hit decline, every month, you lose a certain amount of power. Here's the decline drain.

DeclineDrain = Current Age/Decline age, the resulting number being DIVIDED by your base power level.


Also I forgot, Everyone starts at age 20 when they make a new character, you only start at age 0 if your char was in the offspring tab.

Once you become double your decline age requirement, you are forced to die of old age. Also, if they have hair, when they decline, make it
gray.

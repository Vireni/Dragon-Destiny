In order to get clothes, you need to harvest wool from a sheep NPC. That 1 wool is made into a single article of clothing (i.e a shirt)
To choose colors, yes have the color hexagon, and all the black is replaced with whatever color they choose (Do note that for the darker
tints, I want darker variations of the color, and with lighter tints, I want lighter variations of the color). Also, clothing will NOT
overlay hair or a tail. Which reminds me, something I forgot to put with auras, but auras are also overlays and overlay everything.

I shall have the full list of clothing here (icons not yet finished). I will post all the clothes items here when I finish those icons.

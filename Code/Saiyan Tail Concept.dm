Every Saiyan is born with a tail. Their tail health is always 10% their base health. When a Saiyan is grabbed from behind, their
tail is grabbed. If a Saiyan doesn't have tail training, all of their energy will drain down to 0, and they won't be able to move. If a
Saiyan is attacked from behind in any way (whether attacked physically or with ki) their tail automatically takes the damage alongside their
health. If their tail health reaches 0, the tail is cut off, and therefore they won't be able to transform into an oozaru under the full
moon.Saiyan tails overlay all clothing except capes and cloaks. They do not overlay hair either.
